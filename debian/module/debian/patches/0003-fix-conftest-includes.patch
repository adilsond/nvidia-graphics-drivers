Subject: [PATCH] fix conftest includes

I was trying to test nvidia drivers with the new kernel in experimental
5.7.0-rc5-686-pae. In the build log, I noticed it failed due to missing
functions set_memory_array_wb and friends. However, the code seemed to
be prepared for that possibility, so the problem must be the conftest.

I checked the output from the compilation checks and found some are
failing for the wrong reason, which causes some functions to be wrongly
detected as present (!) and some wrongly detected as missing. This would
probably apply to the other branches of nvidia drivers as well. I
prepared a patch for this, some comments:

- asm/page.h and asm/pgtable.h are needed for the pgprop_t type. Some
  arches have here, some have it there. Otherwise the compilation
  wrongly fails and detects the functions as present

- atomic_long_t is pulled by including linux/atomic.h, not
  asm/atomic.h. Otherwise it's detected wrongly as absent

- linux/acpi.h is needed for acpi_status type

I checked that these files were present in the linux kernel since
2.6.39, but haven't tested compilation with such old kernels. It
should, however, work.
